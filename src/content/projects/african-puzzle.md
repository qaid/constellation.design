## The Challenge

African Puzzle is a platform designed to connect members of the African diaspora worldwide. The founders envisioned a space where people could share stories, celebrate culture, find opportunities, and build meaningful connections across borders.

The challenge was to design an experience that felt authentic to diverse African cultures while being accessible and engaging for a global audience.

## The Approach

This project required deep cultural sensitivity and extensive community involvement. We conducted research across multiple diaspora communities in Europe, North America, and Africa to understand needs, behaviors, and aspirations.

### Research Insights

- Strong desire for authentic representation and storytelling
- Interest in professional networking alongside cultural connection
- Importance of regional and ethnic identity within pan-African context
- Need for both public sharing and private community spaces

## The Solution

We designed a platform built around three interconnected pillars: Stories, Community, and Opportunity.

### Stories

A rich content experience where members share personal narratives, cultural insights, and creative work. The editorial approach celebrates diverse voices and perspectives, with features that highlight different regions, traditions, and experiences.

### Community

Flexible group structures that allow members to connect around shared interests, locations, professions, or cultural backgrounds. Communities can be public or private, with tools for events, discussions, and resource sharing.

### Opportunity

A professional layer that connects talent with opportunities—jobs, mentorship, collaboration, and investment. This section bridges the gap between cultural community and professional advancement.

> "The design captures the spirit of what we're building. It feels like home for our community while being welcoming to everyone."

## Design Principles

Several key principles guided our design decisions:

- **Authentic representation**—Visual design draws from African aesthetics without stereotyping
- **Inclusive by default**—Accessible design that works across devices and connection speeds
- **Community-first**—Features that encourage connection over passive consumption
- **Flexible identity**—Members can express multiple aspects of their identity

## Impact

The platform launched in beta with strong community response:

- 10,000+ members in first three months
- Active communities across 40+ countries
- High engagement rates on story content
- Successful pilot of opportunity matching feature

## Reflection

This project reinforced the importance of designing with communities, not just for them. The most meaningful features emerged from listening to community members and involving them throughout the process. It's work I'm deeply proud of.
